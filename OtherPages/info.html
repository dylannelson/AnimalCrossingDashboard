                <p>This site is made to help players of the game "Animal Crossing New Horizons" Complete their "Critterpedia"</p>
                <p>This is what the critterpedia looks like to the player. It's a log of all the different fish they have caught in the game, and
                    leaves spots blank for those which have not been caught. For many players, one of the main objectives of the game is to complete
                    this catalog. One of the main issues in it's design is it in no way helps the user find the remaining fish.
                </p>
                <p>The issue in the design of the task at hand. Some of the fish require players to go uncomfortably out of their way to find catch them. 
                    Each fish has a specific <b>location</b>, <b>time</b> of day, and <b>months</b> it can be caught in, and just about every one of the 
                    80 fish have a <b>unique</b> combination of the three. Some need to be caught only super late at night, and others can only be caught 
                    in a location you never fished at and was only availible for a few months a year. It's like <em>it almost comes down to the luck of 
                    when you play.</em> The game never explains any of this to you, many people we talked to didn't even know some fish were exclusively
                    found near the end of a waterfall, but we are here to fix that.
