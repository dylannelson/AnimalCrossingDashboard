                <p>This site is made to help players of the game "Animal Crossing New Horizons" Complete their "Critterpedia"</p>
                <p>This is what the critterpedia looks like to the player. It's a log of all the different fish they have caught in the game. One of the 
                    main objectives of the game is to complete this catalog. An issue by it's design is that it doesn't help the user find the remaining fish
                </p>
                <p>Some of the fish require players to go uncomfortably out of their way to find catch them. 
                    Each fish has a specific <b>location</b>, <b>time</b> of day, and <b>months</b> it can be caught in, and most of the 
                    80 fish have a <b>unique combination </b> of the three. Some need to be caught only super late at night, and others can only be caught 
                    in a location you didn't know had unique fish. It sometimes feels like it's all luck, when it really isn't 
                    The game never explains any of this to you, many people we talked to didn't even know some fish were exclusively
                    found near the end of a waterfall, but we are here to fix that.
